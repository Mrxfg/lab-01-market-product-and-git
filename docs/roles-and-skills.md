## Roles and responsibilities

This section describes the main technical roles involved in the product
and explains what responsibilities each role has within the system.

### Backend Engineer
Responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining backend services and APIs.
Uses Git for version control, applies debugging skills to fix issues, and relies on
networking fundamentals to ensure reliable communication between services.

### Mobile Engineer
Develops and maintains mobile applications for iOS and Android platforms.
Uses Git to collaborate with the team, applies debugging skills to fix application
errors, and communicates with backend services over network APIs.

### DevOps Engineer
Manages cloud infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and monitoring systems.
Uses Linux and command-line tools daily, applies networking knowledge to configure
services, and ensures system reliability and scalability.

### QA Engineer
Ensures product quality by designing and executing test cases.
Uses debugging skills to identify defects, applies version control to manage test
automation code, and collaborates closely with developers.

### Security Engineer
Focuses on protecting applications and infrastructure from security threats.
Applies security principles such as encryption and access control, analyzes system
behavior using debugging tools, and reviews configurations for vulnerabilities.

## Common skills across roles

- **Git and version control** — used by all engineers to collaborate on code changes.
- **Linux and command-line tools** — essential for backend, DevOps, and security work.
- **Networking fundamentals** — required to understand service communication and APIs.
- **Debugging and problem-solving** — used across all roles to identify and fix issues.
- **Security principles** — applied to protect user data and system infrastructure.
- **Collaboration and communication skills** — necessary for effective teamwork.

## My chosen role

### Role
Backend Developer

### Skills I already have
- Basic understanding of Git and version control
- Fundamental programming knowledge (C++ / Python)
- Understanding of basic data structures and algorithms
- Basic knowledge of HTTP and client-server architecture

### Skills I clearly lack
- Experience with backend frameworks (e.g., Spring, Django, FastAPI)
- Practical REST API design experience
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms (JWT, OAuth)
- Hands-on experience with databases in real projects


## Job market snapshot

### Skills that appear in several postings
- REST API development
- SQL and relational databases
- Git and version control
- Linux basics
- Problem-solving skills

### Skills specific to a single posting
- Docker and containerization
- Kubernetes
- Message brokers (Kafka / RabbitMQ)
- Cloud platforms (AWS / GCP)


## Personal reflection

I chose the Backend Developer role because I enjoy working with logic,
problem-solving, and understanding how systems work behind the scenes.
After comparing my current skills with market requirements, I see that
I have a solid theoretical foundation but lack practical experience with
backend frameworks and real-world projects.

During this semester, I want to focus on learning REST API development
and working with databases, because these skills appear in almost every
backend job posting and are essential for professional growth.
